## How to reference a hashtag or piece of text?
``To reference a hashtag you can use this link syntax like this [[DocumentName#HashtagTile]]``
Example: [[DUMMY DATA#This is a dummy hashtag to reference.]]

``The syntax so the editor knows to add preview to an url or link is adding ! before the link``
Example: ![[DUMMY DATA#This is a dummy hashtag to reference.]]
